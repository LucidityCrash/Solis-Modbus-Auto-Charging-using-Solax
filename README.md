# Solis-Modbus-Auto-Charging-using-Solax

Experimental code to transfer into your existing HA integration to support Automatic Battery Charging using Solax Modbus on a Solis inverter.  

This code brings together a hardware integration fomulated by @Jumpy07 and software by @Jevburchell to automate your solar PV battery charging.  

Three files exist here - code for your dashboard, code for Template Sensors and code for Helpers.  Instructions on where to copy & paste exist within each repo file.

You must install HACS integrations and frontend as specified in the repo files.

Required HA integrations for this to work are Solax Modbus and Solcast (configured to your existing system).

Feedback welcomed.
